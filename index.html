    <h2>Gashaki Community Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Our community of focus is the Gashaki Sector in Musanze District, Rwanda a vibrant rural area facing governance challenges. 
      Through Women Empowerment, we aim to strengthen participation, accountability, and local economic development in Gashaki.
    </p>

  <section id="problem">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      In the Gashaki Sector of Musanze District, weak community participation and limited accountability continue to hinder 
      effective local governance and sustainable development. Although Rwanda has made significant progress through decentralisation, 
      studies (MKU Repository, 2024) reveal that citizens in Gashaki are rarely involved in planning, budgeting, and implementing 
      local projects. As a result, service delivery remains poor, infrastructure underdeveloped, and household incomes low. 
      The problem mainly affects rural residents, youth, and local leaders who feel excluded from important decision-making processes, 
      leading to mistrust and dependency on external aid. It mostly occurs during community project cycles and public consultations, 
      especially between 2022 and 2025, when local planning sessions take place. The main causes include low public awareness, 
      weak coordination, and limited institutional capacity at the local level. Addressing this issue is essential to promote 
      transparency, accountability, and citizen empowerment, aligning Gashaki’s development with Rwanda’s Vision 2050 for inclusive governance.

  <section id="solution">
    <h2>Our Solution: The Gashaki Governance Hub</h2>
    <p>
      The Gashaki Governance Hub is our proposed solution to strengthen governance through community engagement and 
      women empowerment. The Hub will serve as a local platform for capacity building, dialogue, and collaboration between 
      citizens and local leaders. By fostering transparency, shared decision-making, and economic inclusion, we aim to create 
      a model for sustainable governance and development in Gashaki and beyond.
